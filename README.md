# ECPO full text

This repository contains the code for the experiments documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/exc-asia-and-europe/ecpo-fulltext-experiments/wiki). This code is mostly undocumented and not specifically designed for reusability. Another repository with a reusable OCR pipeline is currently being worked on. 

This is part of the [Early Chinese Periodicals Online project](https://uni-heidelberg.de/ecpo) and its related GitHub repositories:
- [ecpo](https://github.com/exc-asia-and-europe/ecpo) full text ground truth
- [ecpo-backend](https://github.com/exc-asia-and-europe/ECPO-backend) backend of the sql system
- [ecpoweb](https://github.com/exc-asia-and-europe/ecpoweb) web frontend (private)
- [ecpo-segment](https://github.com/exc-asia-and-europe/ecpo-segment) document segmentation based on dh-segment
- [ecpo-annotator](https://github.com/exc-asia-and-europe/ecpo-annotator) annotation tool
- [iipsrv](https://github.com/exc-asia-and-europe/iipsrv) iiif image service

Our progress is documented on the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/exc-asia-and-europe/ecpo-full-text/wiki).
